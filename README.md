## Client-Side Capstone for Cohort 30 @Nashville Software School

Lawn & Order was built to help connect homeowners with the space to garden, but not the time or the interest, with gardeners who are willing to meet and garden on someone else's property. In this application a user can:

### `register as either a Homeowner or Gardener`

A user is prompted upon registration to select either the Homeowner or Gardener role. The application has split views depending on which role the user chose. 

### `post yards as a Homeowner`

A Homeowner is allowed to add as many yards as they have space available. If the Homeowner has multiple properties, they may differentiate their yards by address but unify them under their username. Version 2.0 will allow users to search by username.

### `claim plots as a Gardener `

A Gardener is able to claim a plot which assigns their username to the plot card and registers them in the database as the sole gardener of that plot. Version 2.0 will include multiple Gardeners on one plot.

### `add tools`

Both sets of users are able to add and remove tools that they have added to a yard/plot they are assigned to. No one else is able to make edits to the details of that space. A Homeowner may not edit a Gardeners tools, and vice versa. 

### `edit/view profiles and send messages`

Users can exchange information via private messaging. They are able to access and message anyone registered on the application for ease of access to plots.

### `view resources`

Currently, the only resources a user may view and edit are Tools. A user is urged to add the tools they plan to use on all of their gardens (both as a Homeowner and a Gardener) and may divy those tools up to their respective gardens. The Resource tab serves as a clear "toolbox" for available resources.
